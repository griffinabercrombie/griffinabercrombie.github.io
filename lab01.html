<p>My name is Griffin Abercrombie and as the resident jokester in my family, I have always been one for puns.  No one else in my family understands the comedic genuis that is a great pun.  Personally, the funniest thing to me is a pun that is cleverly placed in natural conversation. </p>

<p> List of my Favorite Puns </p>
<p> 1) I got a job working in a hayfield. After one day I bailed. </p>
<p> 2) Yesterday I accidentally swallowed some food coloring. The doctor says I'm OK, but I feel like I've dyed a little inside. </p>
<p> 3) Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now. </p>
<p> 4) I wondered why the baseball was getting bigger. Then it hit me. </p>
<p> 5) 	Have you ever tried to eat a clock? It's very time consuming. </p>
